# Kubernetes Operator
> Built this thingy to get a grasp on [`operator-sdk`][1] & [Go][2].

## Description

Used the [operator-sdk][1] to generate all this scaffold code in [Go][2].

Chosen Golang because I want to learn more about what this wonderful programming
language can offer.

### What does it do?
ATM this Operator is not so useful - it's just a bogus operator. But in future
it'll do _something_ eventually, still need to decide on the scope.

## FAQ
TBD

## Troubleshoot
